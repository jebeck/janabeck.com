## on the side

most of the time, you can spy on my coding side projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/jebeck?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source) (because they are usually public)

lately, I'm mostly experimenting with music synthesis & visualization

non-coding pursuits include ballet plus pilates and TRX to keep active

I'm also a public transportation enthusiast, a frequent traveler, a bit of a snob about coffee, and a movie nerd (but not that snobby of one)

I have [a blog-shaped space](https://blog.janabeck.com/) where I _very occasionally_ post, but I am always aspiring to post more frequently
