# jana e. beck

@jebeck most places on the Internet, like [GitHub](https://github.com/jebeck) and various Slacks; [@iPancreas](https://twitter.com/iPancreas) on Twitter.

you can also [electronic mail me](mailto:jana.eliz.beck@gmail.com).

## jobs

**presently**: data visualization engineer in [Stitch Fix Algorithms](https://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/)

**formerly**: software engineer at [Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org/)

## on the side

most of the time, you can spy on my coding side projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/jebeck?tab=repositories) (because they are usually public).

lately, I'm mostly experimenting with music synthesis & visualization.

non-coding pursuits include ballet plus pilates and TRX to keep active.

I'm also a public transportation enthusiast, a frequent traveler, a bit of a snob about coffee, and a movie nerd (but not that snobby of one).

I have [a blog-shaped space](https://blog.janabeck.com/) where I _very occasionally_ post, but I am always aspiring to post more frequently. maybe [check it out](https://blog.janabeck.com).
